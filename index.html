                        <h3>Great sizes</h3>
                        <p>Today the <strong>Datejust</strong> is available in three sizes: 31, 36 and 41 mm. Each version
                            comes with a large selection of dials in different colours, finishes and materials. They include
                            diamond-set or mother-of-pearl dials as well as Jubilee, palm and fluted laseretched motifs,
                            which are applied to a traditional sunray finish for a particularly sophisticated effect,
                            exclusive to the Datejust.</p>

                        <h3>Amazing history</h3>
                        <p>reated in <STRONG>1945</STRONG>, the Datejust was the first self-winding waterproof chronometer wristwatch to
                            display the date in a window at 3 o’clock on the dial – hence its name. With its timeless
                            aesthetics, functions and rich history, the Datejust is a watchmaking icon and one of the
                            brand’s most recognizable watches.</p>

                        <h3>Inspierd</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>Datejust’s</strong> enduring aesthetics make it instantly recognizable. The
                            characteristic shape of the Oyster case, the 18 ct gold fluted bezel, the Cyclops lens over the
                            date and the five-piece link Jubilee bracelet – specially made for the model – all contributed
                            to making this watch a classic.  </p>
